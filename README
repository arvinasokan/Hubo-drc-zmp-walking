This is the walking gait for the DRC Hubo

Note:
The following dependencies have to be installed for the code to work
i)   ACH IPC (https://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/40934  & http://golems.github.io/ach/manual/)
ii)  HUBO-ACH (https://github.com/hubo/hubo-ach)


In order to run the code

The hubo-ach daemon must be run in a separate terminal using the following command 
'hubo-ach sim openhubo physics drc'

Finally 'hubodrcwalk.py' should be run in another terminal window.

To try the single foor squat 'hubo-drc-with-squat.py' should be run

The single foot squat is still work in progress,It works works best with the left foot squat
